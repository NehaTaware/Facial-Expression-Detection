# Facial Expression Detection and Classification

This project detects and classifies human facial expressions in real time using OpenCV and machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Real-time webcam-based facial expression recognition
- Emotion classification (happy, sad, angry, etc.)
- Model trained on facial expression dataset

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn or TensorFlow/Keras (for ML model)
- Haar Cascade Classifiers

## Future Improvements
- Increase emotion categories and training data
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
- Add real-time feedback or emoji response
